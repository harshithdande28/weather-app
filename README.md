The project contains code on creating a weather app using nodejs. The app.js, forecast.js, geocode.js are the core files. To properly run the application, use "npm init" and "npm install" to load the respective dependencies. Note: API that  i'm using is "openweathermap", refer it to see the usage of API keys. The input is given to the app using Terminal.
